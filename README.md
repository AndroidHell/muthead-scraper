# Ol Scrappy - Muthead Scraper

website scraper written in ruby

gemfile included so all you should need to do is a quick "bundle install"

written on a local machine but can definitely be ran in the cloud

Possiblke TODOs: 
+ write a frontend or webapp
+ nice landing page with a button to click and run (erb)
+ spits out a downloadable JSON sicne everything is handled very crudely right now
